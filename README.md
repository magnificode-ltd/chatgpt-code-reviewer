# chatgpt-reviewer-github-action

GitHub action that provides a service for adding review comments to a pull request on GitHub. This service uses the GitHub REST API and the OpenAI API to generate suggestions for pull request changes.


### Before you start
By using this repository you acknowledge and approve of the fact that:
* Your code would be sent to OpenAI servers for generating code review suggestions.
* Authors of this github action have no responsibility whatsoever to the consequences of the above, and they would not be liable for anything that happens as a result of using this action.

### Getting Started

To use this github action, you will need to have a GitHub account and an OpenAI API key. Also you will need to configure a GitHub action workflow.

1. In a repository you want to run this action, create a file:
   ```
     .github/workflows/chatgpt-reviewer-github-action.yml
   ```
2. Visit https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys to generate a new OpenAi Api key.
3. Add new secret with a name `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `https://github.com/{user}/{repository}/settings/secrets/actions`. As a value set generated OpenAi Api key from the step 2
4. Update `chatgpt-reviewer-github-action.yml` with:
   ```yml
   name: chatgpt-reviewer-github-action
   run-name: chatgpt-reviewer-github-action
   on:
     pull_request:
       types: [opened, synchronize]
   jobs:
     chatgpt-reviewer-github-action:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout repository
